#  Calendar Core Data

Hey Cole its 3 am and its too late to text you. I have created a smaller project to try to make it work. Still not working, I guess I couldnt catch from where you call the dateComponents inside the func updateUIView. I have tested different options but It didnt work. 
We'll talk soon!
